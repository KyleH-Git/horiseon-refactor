## Description

This project is a refactoring of the Horiseon site. It's main objectives are to properly use semantic HTML practices and to clean up redundant CSS styles.
By adding semantic HTML elements to the index.html file and properly commenting the CSS stylesheet, the codebase will be much easier to read. Additionally a goal of the project is to enhance accessibility by ensuring that the site has properly tagged images for screen reader use. Through this project I gained a greater understanding of HTML semantic elements and CSS selectors.
